/**
 * NZ:AI product page config - v9 copy reframe.
 *
 * The shared product page TEMPLATE is unchanged - same hero with
 * cycling browser frame, same transition, same Let's-show, same
 * numbered steps, same closer. Only the copy and the step count
 * have changed.
 *
 * v9 reframes NZ:AI as a partnership rather than a product:
 *   - Tagline:    "Net zero, built as a partnership."
 *   - Stages:     Decode -> Build -> Partner (three, not four), so the
 *                 NZ:AI page mirrors the home page's three-phase voice
 *   - Voice:      First-person "we" is sanctioned on /nz-ai ONLY (v9
 *                 sign-off). Every other page on the site continues to
 *                 obey the no-we rule from CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * AI mention budget - v9 holds this to exactly three across the page:
 *   1. The brand name "NZ:AI" (microLabel + hero name)
 *   2. The hero one-liner ("AI accelerates the build...")
 *   3. The Build step body ("...built fast because AI accelerates...")
 * Future revisions must hold the budget. If a fourth mention appears,
 * the page is drifting back toward AI-as-headline rather than the
 * partnership AI enables.
 *
 * Spec: /Users/chrisscott/Downloads/NZ_AI_Web_Page_Copy_v9.md
 * (supersedes the v8 brief docs/briefs/nz-ai-copy-v8.md in full).
 *
 * Italic-emphasis fingerprint: the shared template only exposes the
 * step `highlightedVerb` slot for coral italic emphasis. v9's three
 * stage verbs (inside / actually / alongside) sit there. v9's other
 * italic moments (partnership / One / fit) render as part of the
 * template's existing italic tagline / serif headline treatment,
 * which is the closest the current template allows without
 * extending it.
