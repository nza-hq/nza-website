         the prior tagline "Climate action, decoded for education."
         carried an extra clause and is now trimmed to match).

         exists yet, so the href points to /contact?product=decoded

         site's default coral, to match decodED's orange accent + CTAs.

       - Inline gov.uk reference on "climate action plan" in the first
         paragraph, wrapped in the Tooltip primitive. Per Chris (July
         2026) the trigger no longer navigates on its own - hover OR
         click opens an on-brand popover; the reader only lands on
         gov.uk if they click the link inside it.
