/**
 * Navy hero - the landing payoff that sits underneath the cream preloader.
 *
 * Layout per the June 2026 landing brief (v2):
 *
 *   Left column   pinned headline + sub-line (mission statement)
 *                 Headline carries the SlotMachineWord that rotates
 *                 through four words: decarbonisation, climate
 *                 complexity, energy markets, digital intelligence.
 *                 "decode" stays italic coral.
 *
 *   Right column  intentionally empty - the three-beat infographic
 *                 has been removed from the landing per the v2 brief
 *                 ("let the background blob field and the slot-
 *                 machine motion carry the visual interest"). The
 *                 ThreeBeatInfographic component is retained in the
 *                 repo for use on the Approach page later.
 *
 * Background carries a navy-tuned blob field weighted on the right
 * with a mask gradient fading to clean navy on the left, so the
 * headline column sits on solid ground while the right side carries
 * the atmospheric motion.
 *
 * All text wrapped in <MaskReveal> for the site-wide upward-mask
 * arrival motion, staggered by ~200ms so the headline lands first
 * then the sub-line follows.
 *
 * Brief: docs/briefs/nza-landing-page-brief-v2.md
