/**
 * Cream preloader screen. Full-viewport overlay that sits on top of the
 * navy hero until either:
 *   - the 4.5-second sequence completes and auto-transitions out, OR
 *   - the user scrolls manually (auto-transition cancelled, overlay
 *     pinned for the rest of the session)
 *
 * Timing budget:
 *   0.0s - 2.0s   Mark fills with navy from the bottom upward, percentage
 *                 counter ticks 0 -> 100%
 *   2.0s - 3.0s   "NET ZERO" mask-reveal in navy (slab wipes across,
 *                 revealing the SVG wordmark as it passes)
 *   3.1s - 4.1s   "ADVISORY" mask-reveal in coral (same pattern, coral slab)
 *   4.1s - 4.5s   Hold
 *   4.5s          Cream zooms out curving toward the bottom-right of
 *                 the mark, revealing the navy hero
 *
 * The wordmark is the layered SVG (NetZeroAdvisoryLayered) at a
 * confident scale per Chris. Mask reveal: a coloured slab grows from
 * the left, covers the wordmark, then shrinks from the left as the
 * SVG behind it becomes visible - "the slab leaves the text behind".
 * Both wordmarks use the same pattern with their respective colours
 * (navy for NET ZERO, coral for ADVISORY).
 *
 * Background carries a 4-blob field at heavy blur with co-prime
 * durations so the visible pattern never loops.
 *
 * Runs on every device. History (September 2026): the mobile cold-load
 * "blank white screen" was this cream sheet failing to paint under the
 * 14 blur(110px) blob layers + the nav's backdrop-filter, so for a day
 * touch devices skipped the preloader entirely. The real fix was making
 * those layers cheap on touch (static gradient blobs, no nav blur - see
 * landing.css / site-nav.css). With that in place Chris tested the full
 * sequence on his iPhone via ?lab=preloader: "works perfectly", so it
 * is back on by default everywhere. docs/audit/mobile-load-diagnosis.md.
